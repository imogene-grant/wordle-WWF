<h2>Welcome to WWF Conservation Word of the Day</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Each day, there’s a new conservation-themed 5-letter word to guess.</li>
  <li>You have 6 chances to figure it out.</li>
  <li>As you guess, the tiles will give you hints:</li>
  <li>A <span style="color: gray;"><strong>gray</strong></span> tile means the letter isn’t in the word at all.</li>
  <li>A <span style="color: #F5D200;"><strong>yellow</strong></span> tile means the letter is in the word, but not in the right spot.</li>
  <li>A <span style="color: #007932;"><strong>green</strong></span> tile means the letter is in the correct spot.</li>
  <li>Every word is related to wildlife, climate, or the natural world—just like WWF’s mission.</li>
  <li>You can only use real 5-letter words—no shortcuts!</li>
  <li>And yes, the word changes every day. Come back tomorrow for a new one 🌱</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Tip:</strong> After clicking “Generate New Word,” tap anywhere else on the page to continue typing.</p>
<p>Good luck, and thank you for supporting conservation in a fun way!</p>
